        <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</li>

        <li>Beat egg yolks and sugar in a separate bowl until sugar has dissolved.</li>
        <li>Whisk water and pandan paste until smooth; mix thoroughly into egg yolk mixture. Stir in corn oil, then fold in sifted flour.</li>
